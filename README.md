## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML & CSS

I created this site from scratch with pure HTML and CSS. I designed the site with high contrast colors in mind for visual accessibility. I also made sure to label everything for optimum readability by screen readers. There are quite a few hidden easter eggs within the site. See if you can find them!

## Optimizations

Once I was finished with the build, I refactored the site to greatly reduced load times. I accomplished this by converting all of the images into webp and svg format.

## Lessons Learned

I redesigned this site from scratch several times before I decided to stop being a perfectionist and just ship it. Although it was fun and good practice, I learned the importance of knowing when to be happy with my work when the client is happy with my work (in this case, other designers who were impressed).
